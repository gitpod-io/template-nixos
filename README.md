### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with NixOS on Gitpod, copy the contents of this folder to your own project. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

Host `/workspace` dir is mounted inside guest, docker is installed and user-groups are mapped.
